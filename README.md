# FallCheck
**INTRODUCTION:**
Sudden falls can have a significant impact on the elderly and differently-abled people, as they are more likely to sustain injuries and fractures due to their weaker bones and less agile bodies. In addition to physical injuries, falls can result in psychological and social consequences such as loss of confidence, fear of falling again, and social isolation. 
To address this problem, we propose creating a Fall Detector Android App that uses sensors to detect falls and alert emergency services. The app will be tailored to the needs of the elderly, with a user-friendly interface and features tailored to their requirements.

**PROJECT GOAL:**
The primary goal of this project is to create a reliable and accurate fall detection app that will assist elderly people in maintaining their independence and staying safe. The app will be designed to provide timely and accurate fall alerts while minimizing the risk of false alarms. The app will also be designed to be simple to use, even for non-technologists.

**SENSORS:**
To detect falls, the app will use a combination of sensors, including the accelerometer and gyroscope. These sensors will track the user's movements and detect sudden changes in acceleration or rotation that indicate a fall. Furthermore, the app will use GPS to pinpoint the user's location and send accurate information to emergency services.

**APPLICATION SCENARIO DESIGN:**
The app will be designed to run on the user's Android device, tracking their movements and detecting falls in real time. When a fall is detected, the app will sound an alarm and display a countdown timer for the user to cancel the alert if it is a false alarm. If the alarm is not cancelled, the app will send a notification to emergency services or designated contacts, informing them of the user's location and other pertinent information.
In addition to fall detection, future iteration could also include other features to assist elderly people in remaining safe and independent. Medication reminders, emergency contacts, and GPS tracking for family members and caregivers are examples of such features.

**CONCLUSION:**
The Fall Detector Android App with sensors for the elderly will be a valuable tool for preventing serious falls and keeping the elderly safe, thereby improving their overall health and well-being. This app will provide reliable and accurate fall detection while also providing additional features to help elderly people stay independent and connected by combining advanced sensor technology with a user-friendly interface. It may also give their families and caregivers peace of mind, knowing that they have an extra layer of safety and security.
